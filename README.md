# Is your birth day a prime number?
It is a CLI App which lets you know if your birth day and month combined is a prime number or not. This is made using NodeJS.

Validation of input type is also integrated in this app. If you enter String like 'potato' instead of Date format in birth-date, an error is shown.

# How Quiz Works?
1. First, you will enter your name followed by birth-date in DD/MM format.

2. You will then know if your birth day and month combined is a prime number or not.
